> _Trace the Truth._

![Postcard Illustration](./public/postcard-illustration.png)

Postcard is a digital forensics tool dedicated to tracing viral content back to its definitive source. By auditing how much a post has drifted from the ground truth, it calculates a **Postcard Score** to restore credibility in the post-truth era.

    participant U as Verification Platform (/postcards)

    participant P as Forensic Pipeline
    participant I as UnifiedPostStrategy (oEmbed/Jina)
    participant C as Corroborator Agent (Gemini)
    participant V as Verifier Agent (Gemini)
    participant DB as Database (Turso)

    end

    P-->>API: PostcardResponse + ForensicReport

    Note over U: Polls GET /api/postcards?url=...<br/>every 3 seconds for status
    Note over U: When status="completed", displays report
```

## User flow

Users enter a post URL, which triggers the forensic pipeline. Postcard then displays a **Postcard Score** and a detailed subscore breakdown.

Postcard prioritizes the direct URL entrypoint to ensure absolute forensic precision, while maintaining support for screenshot-to-URL resolution as an additional quality-of-life feature.

## Product overview

Postcard is a digital forensics pipeline that takes a social media post URL, traces it back to its original source, and produces a **Postcard Score** (0–100%) measuring how much the content has drifted from the truth.

> _Trace the Truth._

## The problem

Screenshots strip all context. By the time something goes viral, it's been cropped, captioned, and misattributed. Postcard utilizes the **"Wisdom of the Crowd"** to triangulate the primary source and audit it for forensic consistency—providing a scalable solution for restoring context and credibility.

### Our solution

We built a 4-stage forensic pipeline focused on deep audit log generation and corroboration for social media posts:

- **Multimodal ingest.** Postcard utilizes Jina Reader to ingest live content and metadata, establishing the "ground truth" for the forensic audit.
- **Forensic audit.** Postcard uses Playwright to perform direct site checks, verifying origin and ensuring temporal alignment with the reported narrative.
- **Corroboration engine.** Postcard performs deep search across trusted domains to verify claims and find mentions of the content elsewhere to determine its "drift."
- **Verification platform.** Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, providing a clean, terminal-inspired interface for quick, simple forensic verification.
