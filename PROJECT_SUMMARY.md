## What it does

**Postcard** is a digital forensics tool that takes a social media post URL, traces it back to its original source, and produces a **postcard score (0–100%)** measuring how much the content has drifted from the primary truth.

Tagline: _Trace every post back to its source._

## The problem

Screenshots strip all context. By the time something goes viral it's been cropped, captioned, and misattributed. A screenshot of a tweet looks nothing like the original tweet. A screenshot of a news article removes the byline, date, and corrections footer. Postcard reverses that entropy by performing a multi-stage forensic audit of the primary source.

## How it works

**User flow:** Enter Post URL → Forensic Pipeline Runs → Postcard Score + Subscore Breakdown appears.

### Stage 1: URL entrypoint

Users submit the direct source URL for forensic verification. While the system supports screenshot-to-URL resolution, the primary focus is the direct URL entrypoint to ensure 100% forensic precision.

### Stage 2: multimodal ingestion

Postcard uses the **Jina Reader API** to ingest live content and metadata (like counts, absolute timestamps, text) from the provided URL. This establishes the "ground truth" for the forensic audit.

### Stage 3: forensic audit

The system uses **Playwright** to scrape the live site and compute forensic subscores (Origin, Temporal, Visual).

### Stage 4: corroboration

An AI SDK agent loop with **Google Search grounding** performs deep dorking across trusted domains (X, Reddit, and News archives) to verify or refute the claim.

## Key decisions

- **Postcard Noun:** Unified all terminology to "Postcard" (the tool) and "Postcard Score" (the result).
- **JSON SSE:** Used JSON body for `POST /api/postcards` to simplify the OpenAPI spec.
- **Forensic Weights:** Implemented a refined 4-part forensic model (Origin 30%, Corroboration 25%, Bias 25%, Temporal 20%).
- **Vetted Sources:** Implemented TLD-permissive logic (`.gov`, `.edu`, `.org`).
